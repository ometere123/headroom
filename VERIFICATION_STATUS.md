# Verification status

## Verified while packaging this artifact

- `python -m py_compile` succeeds for the contract, Direct Mode tests and integration smoke test.
- `scripts/check_contract_patterns.py` passes. It statically guards the contract network lock, consensus-closure trust boundary, nondeterministic-call placement and consensus-time rule.
- `scripts/check_release.py` passes. Executable/config source is locked to chain `61999` and `https://studio.genlayer.com/api` and rejects 61997, Studio-dev, Snaps, WalletConnect and Privy release paths.
- `scripts/check_frontend_surface.py` passes. Required routes, protocol write actions, injected-wallet methods, fee estimation and finalized-execution handling are present.
- every current frontend TypeScript/TSX source file (17) passes a TypeScript compiler-API parse-diagnostic pass with zero syntax errors.
- the current contract parses to 29 public methods and the authored Direct Mode suite contains 22 test functions.
- the browser integration is generic injected EIP-1193, reads finalized state, estimates fees before writes, waits for finalized receipts and rejects finalized executions that did not return successfully.

## Not claimed

This packaging environment cannot resolve/install the GenLayer Python packages or the frontend npm dependency tree. Therefore this ZIP does **not** claim that the following have run here:

- `genvm-lint`;
- executed `pytest tests/direct/` under `genlayer-test`;
- real-network `gltest`/Studionet consensus;
- `npm run typecheck` with the installed Next/React/GenLayer dependency graph;
- `next build`;
- canonical deployment, deployed-source comparison or live GEN value movement;
- public hosting.

Those are mandatory finishing-agent gates, not optional recommendations. The repository includes CI, deployment tooling, an opt-in live smoke test, `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` and `docs/LIVE_DEMO.md` for completing them without changing the product into an easier demo.
